# Changelog

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/netlify/binary-info/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.0) (2022-06-23)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* The result is now non-nullable and it is a struct with the fields `arch`, `platform`, `runtime`. Runtime is nullable as we can only detect it for ELF binaries for now. If `platform` or `arch` cannot be detected it will throw.
